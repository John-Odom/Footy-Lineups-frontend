## Footy Lineups Frontend

### Developing locally

This project uses Ruby on Rails to start the databases and JavaScrript with React to render on-screen changes.  To start the frontend, I would suggest first kicking up the databases.  You can find the backend at https://github.com/John-Odom/Poke-Teams-Backend.  Read that ReadMe to kick up the APIs. 

Once you have the databases running, you will need to cd back into the frontend directory.  Then:

Run this command:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then you should be good to start developing.
