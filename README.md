## Footy Lineups Frontend

This React/Rails social media app is used to discuss Premier League soccer lineups created by users.  It pulls data from an external API (apifootball.com) to gather the current teams and lineups of English Premier League Teams.  Then users can create ideal lineups that they would like to see utilized by their favorite teams.  

Users are also able to follow other users or be followed by users (think of Twitter).  Once you have followed somebody, you can like or comment on their lineups.  Feel free to be nice!

### Developing locally

This project uses Ruby on Rails to start the databases and JavaScrript with React to render on-screen changes.  To start the frontend, I would suggest first kicking up the databases.  You can find the backend at https://github.com/John-Odom/Poke-Teams-Backend.  Read that ReadMe to kick up the APIs. 

Once you have the databases running, you will need to cd back into the frontend directory.  Then:

Run this command:
```bash
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

Then you should be good to start developing.
